# Tabbed Textarea #

**Please note: this extension is currently in beta. Any feedback is greatly appreciated**

Ever been in a situation where you had a section where one entry only needs one textarea, but another needs three or four?
Don't want to create a bunch of textareas where not every one is going to be used?
Meet Tabbed Textarea!

## Features: ##

* Create pre-defined tabs
* Allow authors to create tabs or only let developers create them
* Create plain textareas or use a textformatter (currently, only CKEditor is tested / supported).
